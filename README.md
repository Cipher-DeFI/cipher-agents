- Checks for reliable price data availability
- Verifies token legitimacy and network support

### 3. Market Data Analysis
- Fetches real-time price data
- Analyzes historical price movements
- Calculates volatility and drawdown metrics
- Integrates Fear & Greed Index sentiment

### 4. Behavioral Analysis
- Evaluates commitment duration psychology
- Assesses portfolio allocation impact
- Provides behavioral improvement insights
- Suggests optimization strategies

### 5. Risk Assessment
- Calculates comprehensive risk scores
- Identifies potential market risks
- Provides risk mitigation recommendations
- Evaluates opportunity costs
